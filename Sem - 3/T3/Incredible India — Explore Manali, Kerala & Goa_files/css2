2. Community & Hyper-Local Solutions
Neighborhood Asset Tracker:
	 A platform for local communities to track shared resources like park equipment, streetlights, or community tools (e.g., ladders, drills). Residents can report issues, and the status is updated in real-time.
Skill-Swap Marketplace:
	 A non-monetary platform where users list skills they can teach (e.g., "Python Basics") in exchange for learning something else (e.g., "Baking"). Focuses on user profiles and a simple "trade request" system.
Verified Local Lost & Found: 
	A community board with image uploads (Bootstrap cards) where users can post found items. The backend uses Python to filter posts by location and category for easier searching.
